# SKVR

XML files of the SKVR corpus (www.skvr.fi), place and collector attribute list and some files relating to the type index. 

SKVR is a collection of historical oral poems in Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic and Finnish languages. It contains 89 247 texts recorded in 1564–1939. SKVR-corpus is a digitized version of the book series ”Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot”, which was originally published in 1908–1948 and 1997. 

The SKVR data is free to use, provided that the Finnish Literature Society SKS is mentioned as the original author. Formally, the poems are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 

Significant part of the data was recorded from speakers of the highly endangered languages of Karelian, Ludic, Ingrian (Izhorian) and Votic. Members of these contemporary language communities may view some uses of their traditions as inappropriate or as instances of cultural appropriation.

Each XML file contains the text of one volume of the original book series. The metadata has been added with place and collector attributes, which may sometimes differ from the original metadata text. The place and collector attribute lists also include attributes used only in the JR corpus. JR digitized is a collection of unpublished poems created to supplement SKVR, and has not been opened yet.

SKVR type index, for some parts, is a work in progress. The information is distributed into several files:
- viitteet_180221 contains the connections of type IDs to the poem IDs (* means the connection of a poem to the type is minor or only potential).
- themetree contains a hierarchical version of the type IDs and their descriptions.
- tyyppiluettelo.xml contains the original IDs, names and descriptions of the type index, but the references to SKVR volumes are not updated.
